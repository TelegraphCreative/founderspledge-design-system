**Assets**

| Type        | Path                                   |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------- |
| JS Source   | `./themes/founders/src/js/app.js`      |
| Sass Source | `./themes/founders/src/scss/app.scss`  |
| Fonts       | `./themes/founders/src/assets/fonts`   |
| Favicons    | `./themes/founders/src/assets/favicon` |
| Images      | `./themes/founders/static/img`         |
| Layouts     | `./themes/founders/layouts`            |

**Layouts**

_Basics_

- Base template file: `baseof.html` (`./themes/founders/layouts/_default/baseof.html`)

- Hugo generates pages based on the `.md` files in the `content` directory

- The layout for each page is determined using the frontmatter variable, `layout`.

- Layouts are stored in the `themes/founders/layouts/page` directory

- Build pages using components found in `./themes/founders/layouts/partials`

_Add a page_

1. Run `hugo add new-page-name.md` Hugo will use the filename as the page handle.
2. Add a new layout to the `themes/founders/layouts/page`.
3. Reference the layout in the markdown file (only title and layout are required variables):

```
layout: how-it-works
```

4. Run `yarn do` to start developing, or `yarn hugo` to generate production files in `public`
